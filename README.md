# Project-6
Pins 2, 4, and 6 are set as outputs. Pin 2 is connected to a green LED, pin 4 is connected to a yellow LED, and pin 6 is connected to a red LED. The analog value measures the voltage level of the battery being tested then multiplies the value by .0048. This is called voltage in the program. IF the voltage is greater than or equal to 1.4 pin 2 will go high turning on the green LED. If the voltage is greater than .8 and less than 1.4, Pin 4 will go high turning on the yellow LED. Anything less than .8 will cause pin 6 to go high, turning on the red LED. Once an LED goes high there is a two second delay before turning off.
